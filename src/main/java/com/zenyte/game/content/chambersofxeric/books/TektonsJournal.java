            + "buildings, clever buildings with magic in the walls. Tekton made buildings for people to praise "
            + "Master in, big buildings with pretty decorations so everyone knows how great Master is. <br> Then "
            + "Master had to leave big city. People ungrateful, didn't understand they should obey Master like "
            + "Tekton did. <br> Tekton left city with Master, and Master's loyal friends. Master came up mountain "
            + "to find funny crystals. <br> Tekton was clever, understood all about crystals. Tekton knew how to "
            + "draw power from crystals to make magic buildings for Master. <br> Tekton not sure how it worked "
            + "anymore. Ever since Master made Tekton so strong, Tekton can't remember much about crystals. Tekton "
            + "can't remember how to make buildings either. <br> Tekton can't remember much about Tekton anymore. "
            + "Didn't Tekton have a spouse back in the big city? Tekton not sure what spouse is for anymore. <br> "
            + "But that okay. Master made Tekton strong, so Master must want Tekton's strength, not Tekton's "
            + "memory. <br> Mountain caves have magic that Master wanted, but Master didn't know how to take it. "
            + "But Tekton clever - Tekton learnt to take the magic from the caves. <br> Tekton built Master a new "
            + "temple on mountain top. Tekton's temple could focus cave magic, bring it out of caves so anyone "
            + "could use it without needing to be as clever as Tekton. <br> Master used Tekton's temple to wield "
            + "cave magic. It made Master very happy. <br> But Master not so happy when everyone else started "
            + "wielding cave magic too, especially nasty high priest. Master didn't really like the high "
            + "priest. <br> Master told Tekton to shut down temple. Master wanted Tekton to find new ways to "
            + "wield cave magic, but so only Master could do it. Tekton broke temple like Master said - but "
            + "only slightly, so Tekton can fix it again if Master ever changes his mind. <br> Tekton tried "
            + "to teach Master how to wield cave magic without needing temple, but Master couldn't do it. Maybe "
            + "Master didn't understand crystals as well as Tekton did. <br> Master not so happy about that. <br> "
            + "One day Master took Tekton into cave, and promised to reward Tekton for all Tekton service. "
            + "Master promised Tekton immortality! Tekton very happy. <br> Master created new body for Tekton "
            + "out of rock and metal from caves, and transferred Tekton's mind into it. Tekton's old body "
            + "disintegrated, but that okay now Tekton's mind was living in shiny new body that Master made. <br> "
            + "Master enchanted Tekton's anvil, and brought it into cave, and taught Tekton to use it to fix "
            + "the new body whenever it get damaged. Master may not understand crystals as well as Tekton, but "
            + "Master still very powerful. <br> New body is very strong, stronger than Tekton's old body. Master "
            + "protected it from magic damage and ranged damage too; anyone want to hit Tekton now, Tekton hit "
            + "them straight back! <br> Now Tekton very strong, but Master's friends were rude. They called "
            + "Tekton stupid. Tekton got confused - new body is what Master made, so new body must be better. "
            + "But Master's friends not want to talk to Tekton anymore, especially nasty high priest. <br> So "
            + "Tekton staying in cave now, near anvil. It safer for Tekton to stay near anvil, so Tekton can "
            + "repair body if it get damaged. <br> Tekton wonders sometimes why new body doesn't understand "
            + "crystals as well as old body did. Tekton wonders what happened to Tekton's spouse from big city, "
            + "or Tekton's children. They sound important, but Tekton can't remember much. <br> But Tekton not "
            + "worried. Master made Tekton this body, so this body must be what Tekton needs to serve Master "
            + "best. <br> Tekton had better keep on using anvil to make body strong, until Master come back to "
            + "give Tekton more work to do. <br> Until then, Tekton can wait for Master.";
