    private static final String CONTEXT = "Learn ye, reader, of the wrath of our Lord Xeric. <br> Learn ye of the "
            + "punishment that awaits those who fail him. <br> Learn ye of the Judgement of the Vanguard. <br> Our "
            + "Lord Xeric forgives not, nor does he forget; learn ye to serve him with fear! <br> The penalty for "
            + "failure is immense; do not risk suffering the same fate as the Vanguard. <br> In our time in Kourend, "
            + "along with his own magical power, Lord Xeric had a mighty army at his command, enforcing his rule "
            + "over the people. <br> Whenever traitors muttered against our Lord, his troops would ravage their homes "
            + "in the dead of night, arresting anyone suspected of disloyalty or rebellion. <br> Under questioning "
            + "by the commanders, who were empowered to use any interrogation techniques they deemed necessary in "
            + "Lord Xeric's service, the traitors would inevitably reveal more suspects for the troops to arrest. <br> "
            + "Thus the power of our Lord Xeric was maintained over his people. <br> The most prominent commanders "
            + "of Lord Xeric's army were known as the Vanguard, three elite officers who rose quickly through the ranks. "
            + "Their cunning on the battlefield, their ruthlessness in the interrogation chambers and their loyalty "
            + "to our Lord were exemplary. <br> Each of the Vanguard was proficient in a different form of combat, "
            + "and when the three stood together, none could prevail against their united power because they would "
            + "share their strength to protect each other. For their successes in his service, Lord Xeric rewarded "
            + "them with the command of his army. <br> Then came the fall. A proletarian uprising caught the army "
            + "by surprise. Had the Vanguard performed their duty, perhaps disaster would have been averted, and "
            + "Lord Xeric would have remained on the throne of Kourend. However, even the legendary Vanguard were "
            + "frail. <br> As their troops were slaughtered around them by the rage of the proletariat, the Vanguard "
            + "fled the city to protect their own skins. <br> Lord Xeric took note of their retreat, and I witnessed "
            + "him vow that their fate would be worse than if they had stayed to die serving him. <br> Lord Xeric's "
            + "word is not given lightly; I shuddered to think what would befall the Vanguard when we found them. <br> "
            + "Even as we marched away from Kourend ourselves, I was sure he would carry out his word and exact "
            + "vengeance on the Vanguard. <br> In time, Lord Xeric led us to Mount Quidamortem, and we established "
            + "our new settlement within its caverns. <br> As our Lord studied the secrets of the mountain, and the "
            + "crystals within its depths, his power increased, bringing great cheer to those of us who still "
            + "survived to serve him. <br> Then, one day, our sentinels reported movement on the flanks of the "
            + "mountain. It was the Vanguard. They had heard of our new settlement on Mount Quidamortem, and had "
            + "come to re-pledge their allegiance to our Lord. <br> Their apology was abject, I will admit. They "
            + "admitted that they had fled the battle, abandoning their duty to Lord Xeric. They pledged that they "
            + "would never fail him again, if he would take them back into his service. <br> I waited for Lord "
            + "Xeric to vent his wrath upon them. But he did not. Instead he welcomed the Vanguard, letting "
            + "them approach his presence - an honour granted only to his most trusted servants. He bade us "
            + "deck them in fine clothes and set out a feast in their honour, as though they were his long-lost "
            + "kin rather than traitors who had failed him. <br> I confess I almost came to doubt the wisdom of "
            + "Lord Xeric - how could he stomach the presence of such craven turncoats, let alone grant them "
            + "such honour? <br> But the wisdom of Lord Xeric had not failed, nor had his memory. <br> Lord Xeric "
            + "invited the Vanguard to enter the caverns with him, so that he could imbue them with the same power "
            + "that he could now draw from the crystals of the mountain. He allowed me to follow, as a witness. <br> "
            + "We travelled through the caverns to a fiery chamber, where glowing lava reflected off the facets of "
            + "a hundred orange crystals. Once there, Lord Xeric invited the Vanguard to lower their defences so "
            + "he could instil into them the power of the crystals. <br> I watched in distaste as the traitors reached "
            + "out to accept the power - power that had never been offered to me. <br> Instead, I saw our Lord's "
            + "expression change. The sickly benevolence in his eyes was replaced with bloodshot wrath, and his face "
            + "contorted into a sneer of derision. The Vanguard realised that they had been tricked - but it was "
            + "too late. <br> Their grasping hands twisted. Their legs buckled. Their skin glowed, as if the heat "
            + "of the chamber's lava had set their blood to boiling. From their mouths came a ghastly bubbling "
            + "scream that rapidly died away as their ruined bodies collapsed to the ground. But that was not the "
            + "end. <br> Lord Xeric waved a hand in a curious gesture, and I felt a magical wave emanating from "
            + "the crystals of the chamber. Writhing on the ground, the Vanguard began to melt and re-form into new "
            + "shapes. <br> Soon three lumpen figures lay, hunching on the ground at Lord Xeric's feet. There was "
            + "no light of intelligence in their eyes; their souls had clearly been destroyed. <br> And then, in "
            + "tones of the coldest malice, Lord Xeric addressed them: <br> <col=a00808> You failed me. <br> <col=a00808> You crawled "
            + "away from my <col=a00808> service to save your <col=a00808> skins. <br> <col=a00808> Know, now, that I do not <col=a00808> forgive such failure. I <col=a00808> do not "
            + "forget such <col=a00808> failure. <br> <col=a00808> Had you fled to the ends <col=a00808> of the world, my <col=a00808> vengeance would have <col=a00808> pursued "
            + "you. <br> <col=a00808> Had you taken your own <col=a00808> sorry lives to escape my <col=a00808> wrath, even beyond the <col=a00808> gates of death my "
            + "revenge <col=a00808> would have come upon you. <br> <col=a00808> Instead you came to <col=a00808> grovel at my feet, <col=a00808> snivelling and begging "
            + "<col=a00808> to be taken back. <br> <col=a00808> Your apology is not <col=a00808> accepted. <br> <col=a00808> Now you can serve me in <col=a00808> your new forms. <br> "
            + "<col=a00808> In life you stood united, <col=a00808> and you betrayed me. Now <col=a00808> I grant you an un-life, <col=a00808> standing united as <col=a00808> before, "
            + "but bound to the <col=a00808> crystals of my caverns so <col=a00808> you cannot fail me again. <br> <col=a00808> Guard my chambers, <col=a00808> protect "
            + "<col=a00808> my secrets until the end <col=a00808> of time.</col> <br> Lord Xeric led me away from that terrible place. I could "
            + "not speak. I could hardly walk, but I dared not show weakness before my Lord. <br> But Lord Xeric "
            + "spoke to me. He knew of the doubts I had harboured, he knew how I had felt when I believed he was "
            + "welcoming the Vanguard back. <br> And my Lord understood. He knew I would not doubt him again. (I never "
            + "have.) <br> That day, Lord Xeric bade me record all that I had seen of the Judgement of the Vanguard. "
            + "My record is to stand as a testimonial to his wrath and his vengeance. I have written it down "
            + "faithfully. <br> So now you have read to the end, reader, learn ye from what I have recorded here. <br> "
            + "Learn ye that, if you must choose between serving Lord Xeric and saving your own skin, our Lord will "
            + "not forgive those who choose poorly. <br> Learn ye from the fate of the Vanguard. <br> And, if ye fail "
            + "to learn... upon your own head be your fate.";
