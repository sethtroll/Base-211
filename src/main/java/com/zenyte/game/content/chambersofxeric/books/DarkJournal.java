            + "lord teaches us that the weak should expect no other fate. <br> Others forced our lord to discipline "
            + "them, some for outright treachery, some for other failings. Let them remain in this cave as a "
            + "testament to the supremacy of our lord! <br> Our lord has graciously appointed me as his new High "
            + "priest, and I shall endeavour to be a more worthy servant than my vain predecessor. Nevertheless, "
            + "though our party was reduced in numbers, our lord has led us to victory over the Guardian in the Deep, "
            + "and has seized the power that he sought. <br> Now we make our camp in the Guardian's chamber, among "
            + "the skulls of its former prey. <br> Although I doubt it has been permanently killed, the Guardian "
            + "will not trouble anyone again for a long time. <br> The weapons and armour that we have developed in "
            + "the caves can stay here, in this place of safety. As our lord now wields power over the crystals of "
            + "the cave, he intends to create a secure seal around our store. He says it would take an earthquake to "
            + "shatter it! <br> I am truly awestruck by the power that our lord now wields. If we were to return to "
            + "Kourend, as he originally planned, I have no doubt that we would regain our former dominion over the "
            + "city with very little effort. <br> However, while our lord remains as secretive as ever - in fact, he "
            + "has become more so after the treachery of our former followers - I sense he has a new plan in mind. <br> "
            + "Perhaps the throne of Kourend has become too small a trophy to satisfy the ambitions of Lord Xeric.";
