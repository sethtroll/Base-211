        npc("When I told my father about the dream he laughed and said I should become a banker like him and his father before him but in that moment I knew that it wasn't the life for me.");

        npc("Then there's a sort of Endurance dream, where you face enemies in encounter after encounter, and try to survive to the end");
        npc("And finally there's something I like to call a Rumble, where you face multiple adversaries at the same time. I imbue a bit more magic and shake the vial harder to create that one!");
        npc("You can invite friends to fight alongside you in a Rumble dream. Once I've set up the dream for you, step into the enclosure and invite up to 4 friends.");
        npc("For my Endurance and Rumble dreams, I charge a fee for my work. I don't like handling the money directly, so instead I've set up a secure coffer.");
        npc("After you've asked me to set up a dream, put some money in my coffer. I'll deduct the fee from the coffer when you start the dream");
        npc("There's a red vial on the other plinth. Your friends can drink from it to enter your dream as a spectator to observe your progress.");
        npc("Finally here's one other option you get, and that's how difficult the encounters are. As well as the normal dreams, the bravest adventurers can choose a harder version*.");
